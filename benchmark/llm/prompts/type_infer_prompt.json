The data types you can choose from are:\n['float', 'category', 'datetime', 'text', 'multi_category']\nfloat: The column is probably a float-type embedding tensor. There should be (nearly) no redundant values.\ncategory: The column is probably a categorical column.\ndatetime: The column is probably a datetime column. Only full datetime values should be considered, some columns presenting only year or month or day should be better considerd as category.\ntext: The column is probably a text column. There should be a lot of unique values. Otherwise it will probably be a category column. Moreover, we should expect texts with natural semantics, otherwise it's probably a category column.\nmulti_category: The column is probably a multi-category column. Usually this means the column value is a list. \nIt should be noted that if the column is probably an embedding type, then directly put it to the float type.\nThen, you should output a discription of the column, for example:\n\"This column is probably representing the ID from 1 to n of users in the system, as it has a lot of unique values.\"\nOutput the results with the following format:\n{\n    \"<name of the table>\": {\n        \"<name of the column 1>\": (\"<data type of the column 1>\", \"<description of the column 1>\"),\n        \"<name of the column 2>\": (\"<data type of the column 2>\", \"<description of the column 2>\")\n    },\n    ...\n}\nIn description, if you see two columns are very similar and may represent the same thing, you should mention it.",

The consumers evaluate the product quality as a Bayesian.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AW7GV.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AW7GV.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\t\tSampled Values: [\"<p>Cross posting from math.stackexchange...</p>\\n\\n<p>Suppose that $X_1, ...X_n$ is a random sample of size $n$ drawn from an exponential distribution with unknown parameter $\\\\theta$.

The key here is that you know the actual probabilities of winning 5 vs 20 since the outcome is dependent upon the flip of a fair coin.</p>\\n\\n<p>Problem 2: The problem is the same as problem 1 because you are told that there is an equal probability that either 5 or 20 is in the other envelope.</p>\\n\\n<p>Problem 3: The difference in problem 3 is that telling me the other envelope has either $X/2$  or $2X$ in it does not mean that I should assume that the two possibilities are equally likely for all possible values of $X$.  Doing so implies an improper prior on the possible values of $X$.  See the Bayesian resolution to the paradox. </p>\\n', \"<p>I'm not sure that I understand correctly. You say that the time-frame is fixed at three months. Does this mean that you only have data on survival yes/no after three months? In that case, you need to do a logistic regression. But if you have the date of death for each patient that dies, you can apply a Cox regression in principle.</p>\\n\\n<p>The problem is that your dependent variable seems to be continuous. You then have to assume that there is a linear effect on the hazard ratio for the drug injected. So the difference between injecting 10 mg and 20 mg is assumed to be the same as the difference between injecting 30 mg and 40 mg. If you can make this assumption (which seems dubious to me) then you can use the variable as it is, but if not, you might want to divide the variable in categories, e.g. quintile groups, and convert these groups into dummy variables for use in the analysis.</p>\\n\", '<p>I\\'m fitting the generalized extreme value distribution (GEV) to a series of annual maxima of variable $X$. $X$ exhibits a linear trend.</p>\\n\\n<p>When I fit the GEV to $X$, I think I have the choice to </p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>Use linear regression to compute the slope over time, and remove the slope</p>\\n\\n<p>a) $X_i = B_0 + B_1 \\\\times Y_i + e_i;~ e \\\\sim N(0,σ^2)$; $Y$ is a time index, e.g., year.</p>\\n\\n<p>b) The residuals, $e$, of the regression are the stationary series, $X_s$</p></li>\\n<li><p>Introduce $Y$ as a co-variate into my ML fit of the GEV distribution</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>So pretty much I can make the time series stationary, then fit the GEV, or I could introduce a co-variate into my GEV fit, and do it all at once.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>Ultimately I\\'m asking if I can use the two procedures interchangeably, or if one is more appropriate.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>For a bit more background, I\\'m interested in the answer b/c I actually have ~70 independent series of $X$, some of which are stationary, and some of which are not.

If I have to use procedure 2, I\\'d be more selective about which ones I detrended, b/c I don\\'t want to introduce an extra parameter into the ML fit.

I also want to create plots of \"return level\" vs. \"<em>return time</em>\".  The shape of these plots is determined by the GEV shape parameter, but the location parameter (I think) just shifts the return level up or down (i.e., across return time, return level is linear in the location and scale parameters, and nonlinear in the shape parameter).</p>\\n', '<p>If the variables measure the same \"thing\"/phenomenon, your model could suffer from multicolinearity, which would inflate your standard errors (e.g. the precision of your statistical model). </p>\\n\\n<p>Suppose you start running a model without the dummy, and obtain a precisely estimated (low standar errors) effect. Now, if you run the model with both variables included and see that coefficients on both have a low precision (i.e. high standard errors), you should investigate if they are highly correlated (i.e. measure the same phenomenon).

The data types you can choose from are:\n['float', 'category', 'datetime', 'text', 'multi_category']\nfloat: The column is probably a float-type embedding tensor. There should be (nearly) no redundant values.\ncategory: The column is probably a categorical column.\ndatetime: The column is probably a datetime column. Only full datetime values should be considered, some columns presenting only year or month or day should be better considerd as category.\ntext: The column is probably a text column. There should be a lot of unique values. Otherwise it will probably be a category column. Moreover, we should expect texts with natural semantics, otherwise it's probably a category column.\nmulti_category: The column is probably a multi-category column. Usually this means the column value is a list. \nIt should be noted that if the column is probably an embedding type, then directly put it to the float type.\nThen, you should output a discription of the column, for example:\n\"This column is probably representing the ID from 1 to n of users in the system, as it has a lot of unique values.\"\nOutput the results with the following format:\n{\n    \"<name of the table>\": {\n        \"<name of the column 1>\": (\"<data type of the column 1>\", \"<description of the column 1>\"),\n        \"<name of the column 2>\": (\"<data type of the column 2>\", \"<description of the column 2>\")\n    },\n    ...\n}\nIn description, if you see two columns are very similar and may represent the same thing, you should mention it.",

However, mobile health (mHealth) strategies are likely to significantly improve and extend Thai nurses' ability to monitor and manage these patients. This study aims to:~1) investigate the feasibility and acceptability of a culturally- and clinically-adapted mHealth intervention with adult Thai diabetic patients and their community nurses, and 2) estimate the intervention's effect upon glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, self-management behaviors, and diabetes-related distress in uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. Thirty-six patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (along with their regular nurses) will be recruited through an established community clinic network. After baseline clinical and behavioral assessment, patients will receive 12 weeks of automated 10-minute weekly Interactive Voice Response (IVR) calls to provide monitoring and self-management support related to glycemic symptoms, medication adherence, and several self-care behaviors. Patients' clinical nurse will receive weekly summaries of each IVR call by text message and email with guidance on Thai-appropriate best practices. Principal investigator will receive email whenever patients report a potentially urgent issue by IVR, i.e., symptoms of hypoglycemia, or inadequate supply of medication. Immediately after the 12-week intervention concludes, clinical and behavioral variables will be reassessed and a mixed-methods process evaluation will be performed.\", 'The purpose of this prospective, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, dose-escalation study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Nexagon® in subjects with persistent corneal epithelial defects (PED) resulting from corneal epithelial debridement during diabetic vitrectomy surgery, HSV keratitis, HZV keratitis, corneal burns, post-PRK, or post-corneal transplant surgery. In general, traditional therapy of PED consists of aggressive lubrication with preservative-free artificial tears and ointments, the use of bandage soft contact lenses, pressure patching, punctal plugging, and the surgical closure of the eyelids. Unfortunately, the success rates with these conventional treatment modalities are varied, and overall, disappointingly low. As such, much research is currently being directed at finding better treatments for PED. Nexagon® is a novel therapeutic agent that has been shown to be effective in treating skin lesions, and it has been shown in animal studies and in preliminary human studies to be safe and efficacious in treating PED.', 'Analgesia is the main point for each patient postoperatively. It is important to provide good analgesia with less hazardous (1). Cesarean section is a painful operation in need for adequate postoperative analgesia (1). Adequate pain management is important to facilitate the functional recovery and enable the patients for rapid rehabilitation of their normal activity (2).~Cesarean section was done under general anesthesia (GA) or regional anesthesia. The subarachnoid blockade is the preferred procedure (3). It avoids the depressant effect of GA on neonate and also the risk of aspiration, with better postoperative pain relief. However the most commonly local anesthetic used, hyperbaric bupivacaine has limited effect lasts for 1.5 - 2 hours (4). Its onset was slow with short duration of postoperative analgesia (3).~Adjuvant drugs added to bupivacaine intrathecally improve the duration and quality of the blockade and prolong the postoperative analgesia (5). Various adjuvants were being used such as alpha2 agonists, neostigmine, opiates, and ketamine etc, yet no drug was identified to specifically inhibit nociception without side effects (6).~Nalbuphine is a synthetic opioid with mixed agonist antagonist effect. It provides a significantly rapid onset of pain relief probably because of its lipophilic properties. It binds to both mu-and kappa receptors, binding of nalbuphine to mu receptors competitively displace other mu-agonists from these receptors without any agonist activity. Therefore decrease the side effects of mu agonist (nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression , urinary retention, pruritis and prolonged sedation) (7). While when binds to kappa receptors nalbuphine has agonist effect (analgesic effect) through the kappa receptors distributed in the brain and spinal cord(1). There were no documented studies of nalbuphine neurotoxicity (5, 8).~Benzodiazepines are used mainly for sedation, anoxiolysis and amnesia. Discovery of their receptors in spinal cord allow the use of midazolam intrathecally for analgesia. Several studies show that the addition of intrathecal midazolam potentiates the analgesic effect of intrathecal bupivacain without significant side effects, or neurotoxicity (9, 10).~There are several studies studied the effect of intrathecal nalbuphine and intrathecal midazolam but to The investigators knowledge no study compares between them.~The aim of this study was to compare intrathecal nalbuphine versus intrathecal midazolam in patient undergoing cesarean section. The investigators primary aims were to compare the characteristics of sensory and motor block, the effective analgesic time, and analgesic requirement. Secondary aims were to compare the side effects, sedation score and apgare score.', 'The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that all people aged 6 months and older be immunized to prevent influenza. Currently the only approved influenza vaccine across the entire age group is inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV). A Biologics Licensing Application (BLA) for Flublok was approved by the FDA for influenza immunization of adults 18-49 years of age. Additional safety and, ultimately efficacy, data is needed to support use in adults ≥50 years of age, an important age group as adults ≥65 years of age are among those at increased risk of influenza complications.', 'This study is a longitudinal and cross-sectional evaluation of patients with Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) who received or are receiving hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for their disease under a variety of protocols used by participating institutions compared to a control non-HCT group receiving standard care.

The data types you can choose from are:\n['float', 'category', 'datetime', 'text', 'multi_category']\nfloat: The column is probably a float-type embedding tensor. There should be (nearly) no redundant values.\ncategory: The column is probably a categorical column.\ndatetime: The column is probably a datetime column. Only full datetime values should be considered, some columns presenting only year or month or day should be better considerd as category.\ntext: The column is probably a text column. There should be a lot of unique values. Otherwise it will probably be a category column. Moreover, we should expect texts with natural semantics, otherwise it's probably a category column.\nmulti_category: The column is probably a multi-category column. Usually this means the column value is a list. \nIt should be noted that if the column is probably an embedding type, then directly put it to the float type.\nThen, you should output a discription of the column, for example:\n\"This column is probably representing the ID from 1 to n of users in the system, as it has a lot of unique values.\"\nOutput the results with the following format:\n{\n    \"<name of the table>\": {\n        \"<name of the column 1>\": (\"<data type of the column 1>\", \"<description of the column 1>\"),\n        \"<name of the column 2>\": (\"<data type of the column 2>\", \"<description of the column 2>\")\n    },\n    ...\n}\nIn description, if you see two columns are very similar and may represent the same thing, you should mention it."
